        The CCIP 2017 is the third line of series of International conferences on cognitive computing and Information processing behind held in Bengaluru, India. The second conference CCIP 2016 was held at SJCE, Mysore during August 2016. The first conference CCIP 2015 was held at JSSATE – Noida during March 2015.
        <p>The latest advances and engineering applications of cognitive computing and information processing has led to the emergence of multi-disciplinary research field like cognitive science, machine learning and big data analytics. In the recent years, computing capability has increased many-fold, and correspondingly data volumes have grown by an even larger amount.</p>
        <p> Growing technical possibilities to gather and aggregate multi-modal data from sensors, mobile devices, social media, log files, cameras, microphones etc. provide large and complex data sets, known as Big Data. This type of data is characterized by high volume, high velocity and high variety information. The effective analysis of big data is needed to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other useful information that can provide enhanced insight and decision making. The handling of such large datasets can lead to a number of challenges, relating to the storage, sharing and analysis of data. These challenges have opened up whole lot of avenues for research and innovation, not just in computer science and IT, but also in other disciplines such as medical, agriculture, astronomy, social media, environmental science etc. The need to effectively solve these challenges of big data is a growing concern and interest. This conference aims at bringing researchers, graduate students, practitioners from industry to report and review current progress in the field of Cognitive Computing and Information Processing.
